# Empirical fits to inclusive electron-carbon scattering data obtained by deep-learning methods
-----


## Info
---
We introduce the deep neural networks fits to inclusive electron-carbon scattering data. There are two models available A and B.

* Model A:
    It is based on an ensemble of 50 neural networks, which fit clone datasets.
* Model B:
    It is a single neural network with dropout layers. The Monte Carlo dropout mechanism is used to make predictions.

## Making Predictions
---
To run the model:
* Install jax package ()
* to make model A predictions for elecgtron Energy E, scattering angle theta and ..
    run `xxx yyy zzz`
* to make model B predictions for elecgtron Energy E, scattering angle theta and ..
    run `xxx yyy zzz`
